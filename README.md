<u>Task:</u>

<u>Card Game Lab </u>

This lab is to model a basic card game and implement the rules.

We arenâ€™t looking for a running game, just good TDD to demonstrate that the game works as it should.

Highest Card

<u>MVP</u>

Create a Deck class with an ArrayList of cards. (Deck should start of empty)

Come up with a method to populate the deck of cards.

Find a way to shuffle the cards.

Create a method to deal a card from the deck.

<u>Extensions</u>

Build a simple card game that has a dealer deal one card to every player and the player with the highest card value in their hand wins.
